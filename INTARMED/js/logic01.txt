Part II 
1. A hemiacetal is present within the disaccharide, which means that it can act as a reducing agent, making it a reducing sugar.
2. The coconut oil is mainly composed of saturated fatty acids. On the other hand, olive oil is composed of unsaturated fatty acids. Since coconut oil can be easily stacked onto each other due to the lack of double bonds, it can easily solidify at a higher temperature compared to olive oil
3. The natural waxes would be hydrolized by the acids in the acid rain. This releases the fatty acids from the alcohol, thus harming the leaf cuticle.
4A. The hydrophilic parts of the phospholipid would be on the outside of the sphere since it is attracted to water while the non-polar ends would be the ones lining the inside of the sphere
4B. The hydrophilic parts of the phospholipid would now be on the inside since it wouldn't be attracted to the solvent due to the difference in polarity. In order to further prevent the interaction between the hydrophilic ends and the nonpolar solvent, the hydrophobic ends would compose the outside of the sphere.

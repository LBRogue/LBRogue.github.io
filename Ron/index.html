			<p id = "song">To the Yin to my Yang, the Naruto to my Sasuke, the among to my us... Baby, baby, you're my sun and moon
Boy, you're everything between
A lot of pretty faces could waste my time
But you're my dream boy
You make flowers bloom
Boy, you make the stars collide
And I don't know what I did
To get lucky like this but it sure feels fine

'Cause you give me love and affection
I give you all my protection
I'm tryna stay by your side till the day I die
And you give me all of your love
And I give you all of my trust
I know you'll never betray me and leave my side, oh my

Baby, baby, you're my sun and moon
Boy, you're everything between
A lot of pretty faces could waste my time
But you're my dream boy
You make flowers bloom
(Boy, you make the flowers bloom)
Boy, you make the stars collide
(Don't you know you make the stars collide?)
And I don't know what I did
To get lucky like this but it sure feels fine

'Cause I see your face when I'm sleepin'
I wake up grateful to breathe in
The air you float through, I wrote you a lullaby
A song to sing on your pillow
Swift as a swing on a willow
My sweetest words I'm the birds in your perfect sky, oh my

Baby, baby, you're my sun and moon
Boy, you're everything between
A lot of pretty faces could waste my time
But you're my dream boy (Boy)
You make flowers bloom
(Boy, you make the flowers bloom)
Boy, you make the stars collide
(Don't you know you make the stars collide?)
And I don't know what I did
To get lucky like this but it sure feels fine
I need a lover to keep me sane
Pull me from hell, bring me back again
Play me the classics
Something romantic
Give him my all when I don't even have it
I always dreamed of a solemn face
Someone who feels like a holiday
But now I'm in pieces
Barely believing
Starting to think that I've lost all feeling
You came out the blue on a rainy night
No lie
I'll tell you how I almost died
While you're bringing me back to life
I just wanna live in this moment forever
'Cause I'm afraid that living couldn't get any better
Started giving up on the word "forever"
Until you gave up heaven, so we could be together
You're my angel
Angel baby, angel
You're my angel, baby
Baby, you're my angel
Angel baby
I fall in love with the little things
Counting the tattoos on your skin
Tell me a secret
And baby, I'll keep it
And maybe we could play house for the weekend
You came out the blue on a rainy night
No lie
I'll tell you how I almost died
While you're bringing me back to life
I just wanna live in this moment forever
'Cause I'm afraid that living couldn't get any better
Started giving up on the word "forever"
Until you gave up heaven, so we could be together
You're my angel
Angel baby, angel
You're my angel, baby
Baby, you're my angel
Angel baby
All the sick and twisted nights that I've been waiting for ya
They were worth it all along, yeah
I just wanna live in this moment forever
'Cause I'm afraid that living couldn't get any better
Started giving up on the word "forever" (on the word "forever")

(Don't you know you make the stars collide?)
And I don't know what I did
To get lucky like this but it sure feels fine
Baby, baby, you're my sun and moon
Boy, you're everything between
A lot of pretty faces could waste my time
But you're my dream boy
You make flowers bloom
(Boy, you make the flowers bloom)
Boy, you make the stars collide
(Don't you know you make the stars collide?)
And I don't know what I did
To get lucky like this but it sure feels fine, oh my, oh my

Oh my, oh my, oh my
Yeah, oh my, oh my
Baby, baby, you're mine
Baby, baby, you're my sun and moon
Boy, you're everything between
A lot of pretty faces could waste my time
But you're my dream boy
You make flowers bloom
Boy, you make the stars collide
And I don't know what I did
To get lucky like this but it sure feels fine

'Cause you give me love and affection
I give you all my protection
I'm tryna stay by your side till the day I die
And you give me all of your love
And I give you all of my trust
I know you'll never betray me and leave my side, oh my

Baby, baby, you're my sun and moon
Boy, you're everything between
A lot of pretty faces could waste my time
But you're my dream boy
You make flowers bloom
(Boy, you make the flowers bloom)
Boy, you make the stars collide
(Don't you know you make the stars collide?)
And I don't know what I did
To get lucky like this but it sure feels fine

'Cause I see your face when I'm sleepin'
I wake up grateful to breathe in
The air you float through, I wrote you a lullaby
A song to sing on your pillow
Swift as a swing on a willow
My sweetest words I'm the birds in your perfect sky, oh my

Baby, baby, you're my sun and moon
Boy, you're everything between
A lot of pretty faces could waste my time
But you're my dream boy (Boy)

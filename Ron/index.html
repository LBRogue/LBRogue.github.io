			<p id = "song">To the Yin to my Yang, the Naruto to my Sasuke, the among to my us... Baby, baby, you're my sun and moon
Boy, you're everything between
A lot of pretty faces could waste my time
But you're my dream boy
You make flowers bloom
Boy, you make the stars collide
And I don't know what I did
To get lucky like this but it sure feels fine

'Cause you give me love and affection
I give you all my protection
I'm tryna stay by your side till the day I die
And you give me all of your love
And I give you all of my trust
I know you'll never betray me and leave my side, oh my

Baby, baby, you're my sun and moon
Boy, you're everything between
A lot of pretty faces could waste my time

And I don't know what I did
To get lucky like this but it sure feels fine

'Cause I see your face when I'm sleepin'

A song to sing on your pillow
Swift as a swing on a willow
My sweetest words I'm the birds in your perfect sky, oh my
